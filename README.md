# Automated-Car-Catalog-System-for-Enhanced-Showroom-Management

📘 Project Overview
The Automated Car Catalog System is a ServiceNow-based automation project that streamlines the car showroom management process.
It automates the workflow of car catalog requests — from selection and approval to delivery and inventory updates — ensuring faster processing and improved efficiency.

This system eliminates manual steps in the car ordering process, enabling showroom staff and customers to manage vehicle requests through a centralized and user-friendly ServiceNow platform.

🧩 Key Features
🏷️ Car Catalog Management – Displays available car models with details such as model name, engine type, price, and color.
⚙️ Automated Request Workflow – Users can submit car requests directly from the Service Catalog.
✅ Approval Process – Requests are automatically routed to the manager for approval.
📋 Task Automation – Approved requests create catalog tasks like vehicle allocation and delivery scheduling.
📧 Email Notifications – Automated alerts for each stage (submission, approval, delivery).
🚘 Inventory Update – Car availability is automatically updated after delivery.
📈 Reports & Analytics – Provides real-time insights into requests, approvals, and deliveries.
⚙️ ServiceNow Components Used
Service Catalog – To display and manage car catalog items.
Flow Designer / Workflow Editor – For automation of request, approval, and task creation.
Tables and Forms – To store and manage request and car details.
